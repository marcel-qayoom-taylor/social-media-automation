Automating the manual social media posting I currently do. 

One job is to post a weekly article. Once edited and prepared, posting the article across mailchimp, linkedin, twitter, facebook, instagram, medium and squarespace takes me about ~25 minutes. I think I can reduce this to an input gui and a script that runs in 10 seconds and will take 5 minutes max to review everything before hitting the final "publish" for each platform. This means an approximate 80% reduction in time. 20 minutes per week means saving $11.55 per week (base rate of $38.50)

There are other tasks like publishing podcast which I estimate takes 45 minutes. This can be reduced to similar 5 min input review time.
