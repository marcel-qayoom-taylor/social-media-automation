    "body": "Energy is one of the most important macroeconomic themes shaping the global investment landscape in the decade ahead. From the demand for oil and gas to the geopolitical factors affecting energy supply chains, the importance of energy in determining economic growth, market dynamics, and investment returns cannot be overstated. It is critical for investors to have exposure to this sector in your portfolio for the long term. \nWhile much of the world has focused on the transition to renewable energy, from a pure investment perspective, it has distorted parts of the energy market. Fossil fuels still account for over 80% of the global energy mix, and despite the growth of renewables, that figure is expected to remain high for at least the next decade. This is due in part to the sheer scale of global energy demand, particularly in emerging markets, where industrialization and population growth are driving a need for more energy. \nThe world needs an ever-increasing amount of energy to power the activities of the future. AI is a massive extra and unexpected demand on energy. The additional energy required to power the AI energy demand will see AI energy demand double by 2026, from 2% of global demand to 4% of global demand. Of course that is just the start. But even that equates to all the energy required to power Japan for a year being added to global energy requirements.  \nPart of the problem with the transition to renewables was that it was too expensive to produce enough to meet demand. Simultaneously, it became politically difficult for the oil and gas industry to gain the investment needed to fill the shortfall. Consequently, the world has drastically underinvested in energy and energy infrastructure over the past decade and that will need to be rectified. Global spending on data centers alone is estimated to be $US2 trillion by 2029 (Blackstone) so high energy-demanding technologies from data centers to AI require a long runway of energy demand for the rest of the decade and beyond.  \nEnergy has always been a geopolitical issue, and the coming decade is unlikely to be any different. As countries vie for control over energy resources and supply chains, geopolitical tensions will continue to affect energy markets. The Russia-Ukraine war has caused widespread disruption in global energy markets, leading to supply shortages and spiking prices, particularly in Europe. More recently, tensions in the Middle East have seen increased volatility and prices spike.  \nAs countries worldwide move toward energy independence in the interest of national security, geopolitical risks can be a double-edged sword for investors. The price of oil fell as low as the US$70 a barrel mark about two weeks ago on the prospects of a weaker global outlook before jumping quickly to around US$80 a barrel today. It is important to remember that the USA dramatically depleted their emergency oil reserves in their bid to curb inflation and pledged to replenish this reserve at US$70 a barrel. This potentially provides a floor under the price.  \nThe investment opportunities in energy are broad. I think the simplest way to gain exposure is through blue chip companies in the oil and gas sector as well as uranium. We hold stocks such as Woodside, Santos, Chevron, and Cameco. I am less bullish on the renewables space because in many cases it is more dependent on technology bringing prices down over time. Many of the investments therefore are more complicated than I like and while they may appear to be energy stocks, they are effectively higher-risk technology companies. There are also massive opportunities in energy utilities and energy storage. \nEnergy will be one of the most important macroeconomic themes of the decade ahead. The demand for energy from emerging countries and industries, the importance of energy storage, and the geopolitical complexities of energy supply chains all underscore the central role energy will play in shaping markets and investment strategies. We are still at the start of a massive global energy expansion that will be a core component of our investment portfolio for the long term.",
